REMARK  THIS SCRIPT READS A PROTEIN PSF AND STRUCTURE AND THEN BUILDS A GRID          
REMARK  POTENTIAL TO REPRESENT THAT PROTEIN FOR LIGAND FRAGMENT DOCKING USING         
REMARK  FFT-BASED FRAGMENT DOCKING. THE PROTEIN IS STRANSLATED AND ORIENTED TO        
REMARK  SITE AT THE ORIGIN WITH ITS MAJOR AXES ALONG AN ORTHOGNAL COORDINATE          
REMARK  SYSTEM. FROM THIS PROTEIN STRUCTURE A 3D DOCKING GRID IS BUILT AND            
REMARK  EACH OF 16 DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL GROUP FRAGMENT PROBES ARE DOCKED.             
REMARK  THE DOCKED PROBES ARE CLUSTERED AND THE CLUSTER CENTER IS EVALUATED           
REMARK  FOR IT'S DOCKING ENERGY.
